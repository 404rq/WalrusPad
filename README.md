# WalrusPad
Open source code editor for people that don't want to lose their work. By combining the advantages of AvalonEdit and AvalonDock with FTP modules and support for network paths this code editor allows you to continue your work without being afraid of losing anything. Backups are automatically created when opening files from network locations as well as FTP servers allowing you to edit files directly on the server. The main purpose of this project is web development and scripts.
