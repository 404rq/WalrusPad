# WalrusPad
Open source code editor for people that don't want to loose their work. By combining the 
advantages of AvalonEdit and AvalonDock with FTP modules and support for network paths 
this code editor allow you to continue your work without being afraid of loosing anything.
Backups are automatically created when opening files from network locations as well as FTP 
servers allowing you do edit files directly on the server. The main purpose for this project 
is web development and scripts.

**Warning** _There is currently no active development in progress on this project, it's also not 
recomended to use over internet or in wireless networks without encryption as it uses FTP to 
transfer files FTP sends usernames and passwords in cleartext._
